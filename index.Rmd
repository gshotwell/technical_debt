# Most technical debt is a failure to *communicate* or to *consider*

---

## Communication

--

- Bad Documentation 

--

- Poor test coverage

--

- Code style 

- Project organization

---

## Consideration
--

- Code isn't robust

--


- Code can't be updated easily

--


- Doesn't solve future problems

--


- Fragile dependencies

- Doesn't scale

## <br>Users get coddled.

--

## Maintainers get opinions.

---

## Being a good maintainer

--

- Responsible for delight

--

- Product responsibility

--

- Product authority

--

- Never blame the user
--

- Never ask the user to maintain
---

## Being a good user

--

- Define delight

--

- Don't be too smart!

- Don't work too hard!

--

- Ask about the *problem* not the *solution* 

--

- Complain without embarrassment

- Refuse to read source code

### If people do not welcome your input on code style, you are a user.

---
## Useful questions:

--

"Can we use tabs instead of spaces?"

--

"Have you thought about Python Black?"

--

"My IDE really works best with 87 character line lengths ..."

--

"The data.table syntax is much more concise than tidyverse"


---
# Can you add this function?

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/poop_emoji.png", dpi = 1)

# Empathize with the Debtor
<br>
- Fear makes learning impossible 

--

- Empathy diffuses fear
--

- More often than not the debtor is you
---

# Thank your code
--
<br>
- Technical debt is a good sign

--

- Thoughtful people doing their best


--

- Thank the debt
